Movies

This is how it feels to be in love
This is life from above
There's no books anymore
I'm bound to that summer
Big box office hit
Making love to a counterfeit
 
Why did so many
Get a rise out of me?
I love the movies
 
Some people feel what some people don't
Some people watch until they explode
The meaning of life doesn't seem to shine like that screen
 
Put me in a movie and everyone will know me
You'll be the star you know you are
The movies I watched when I was a kid
The hopes and the dreams
Don't give credit to the real things
I love the movies
 
I know the meaning
I know the story
I know the glory
I love movies
 
I wanna be in my own movie
I wanna be
I wanna be the star of mine
Of my own, my own
My own
I wanna be the star
I wanna be
I wanna be the star of mine
Of my own, my own
My own
